# A humanitarian emergency management system

During a natural disaster, people flee their homes to more secure camps where they can receive
medical assistance, food, and shelter. To distribute resources equally, humanitarian agencies
need to record the number of refugees and their needs at every available camp. 

Created the system working in a team of 6 people.
